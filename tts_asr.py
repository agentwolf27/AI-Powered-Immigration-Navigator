# tts_asr.py
# This file provides a conceptual outline for integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
# and Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipelines.
# Potential resources for model training/fine-tuning include:
# - CommonVoice (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/) for ASR: Provides a large, multi-language dataset of voice recordings.
#   Models could be pre-trained ones from libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) or fine-tuned on CommonVoice.
# - Tatoeba (https://tatoeba.org/): Provides a large database of sentences and translations.
#   This can be invaluable for training TTS models, especially for multilingual capabilities,
#   and for creating datasets for speech translation tasks.
