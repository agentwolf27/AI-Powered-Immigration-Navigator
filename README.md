# AI-Powered Immigration Navigator

This project provides a lightweight demonstration of a full-stack assistant for immigration guidance and wellness support. It uses **FastAPI** for the backend and a simple HTML/JavaScript front end.

Features include:

- Immigration step guidance
- Auto-filled PDF form generator
- Mental wellness sentiment check
- Basic text translation
- Example timeline display

Run the backend with:

```bash
uvicorn immigration_navigator.backend.app:app --reload
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/` to use the web interface.
